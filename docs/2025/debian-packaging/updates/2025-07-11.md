# Week 1


## Debian Packaging Progress

This week focused on setting up a clean Debian packaging workflow for Fossology and beginning the actual packaging work using `git-buildpackage (gbp)`.

- Cloned the [Fossology Salsa repository](https://salsa.debian.org/fossology-team/fossology) using `gbp`, including the `upstream`, `pristine-tar`, and `master` branches.
- Imported the upstream tarball (`fossology_4.5.1.orig.tar.gz`) via `gbp import-orig`.
- Cleaned and updated the `debian/control` file to list all binary packages properly with accurate descriptions and dependencies.
- Verified and integrated CMake-based build support through `dh_auto_configure` and `dh_auto_build`.
- Fixed a build failure related to `make clean` by removing the generated `obj-*` build directories manually.
- Manually handled PHP vendor libraries by copying the `src/vendor/` directory into `debian/fossology-common/` since composer is not invoked during build.
- Removed the unnecessary `.install` file for `fossology-common` after migrating installation steps directly into the `debian/rules` file.
- Handled the `install/db` directory manually via a custom `make` command in `debian/rules`, since it lacks a standard `make install` target.
- Successfully generated all `.deb` packages using `gbp buildpackage` without fatal errors.

## Meeting 1

**Date:** Jul 10, 2025

This was a community-wide meeting with contributors and organization admins. Each GSoC contributor gave a short summary of their progress so far. I shared an overview of my packaging work, including the repo setup, how I’m using `gbp`, and how I’m building multiple `.deb` packages for Fossology.

## Meeting 2

**Date:** Jul 10, 2025

This was a focused technical meeting with mentors. I walked them through my progress in detail, including how I handled the upstream tarball, debian/control cleanup, PHP dependency setup, and manual handling of install/db. They confirmed I was on the right path and gave the following key suggestions for the next steps:

- Convert `install/db` to use CMake instead of a raw `make` call in `debian/rules`.
- Handle PHP Composer dependencies more properly — ideally by integrating `composer` or isolating the vendor files in a better way.
- Ignoring lintian warnnings for now
---

## Planning Next Week

For Week 2, I plan to:

- Create a `CMakeLists.txt` file under `install/db` and include it in the build system.
- Update the packaging process to stop using manual `make` commands.
- Explore better ways to handle `vendor/` dependencies, possibly via patches or pre-installed during build.
- Start fixing `lintian` warnings and bring the package closer to Debian standards.

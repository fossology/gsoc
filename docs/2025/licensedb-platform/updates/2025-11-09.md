- Throughout the project, key components were completed:
  - **Authentication Enhancements:** refresh tokens, stricter validation, and improved session handling.  
  - **Migration System Fixes:** resolved the GIST index down-migration issue and improved migration consistency.  
  - **Similarity Search Feature:** implemented fuzzy text matching using Levenshtein + pg_trgm + GIST index to prevent duplicate licenses and obligations.

## 📝 Summary  

This final week marked the completion of major feature sets including authentication, migrations, and similarity search.  
With the refresh token system merged and test cases strengthened, the core backend is more stable and robust.  
Although the messaging system requires final adjustments, work will continue post-GSoC, along with broader contributions to help LicenseDB evolve further.

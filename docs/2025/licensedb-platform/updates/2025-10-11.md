# Week 18  

*(October 6, 2025 – October 12, 2025)*  

## Meeting  
No meetings were conducted this week as the mentor was occupied with other commitments.  

---

## Updates  
- Progress remained on hold as the mentor was **busy with workload**, leading to delays in PR reviews.  
- All submitted PRs continue to be in the **awaiting review** state.  
- No new development work was taken up during this period to avoid moving ahead without feedback.  

---

## Planning for Next Week  
- Follow up on pending PR reviews once mentor becomes available.  
- Resume development based on review feedback.  
- Continue with the final **monorepo setup** work once reviews unblock progress.

# WEEK 1
*(June 4, 2025)*

## Attendees:
- [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)
- [Ayush Kumar Bhardwaj](https://github.com/hastagAB)

### Engagements
* I engaged in the installation of Fossology locally, and solved the obstacle of working with Windows. Since Fossology installation guide works best with Linux, I was able to achieve this installation with WSL2.
* I also conducted various examples on the Safaa agent to tests out it features and functionalities which also gives me the insight of how it currently works. You can find this here.

## Discussion:
* I discoursed about how I installed Fossology with the link provided for me by my mentors and familiarized myself with its features. 
* Furthermore, I discussed with them about the test I conducted with Safaa current copyright detection agent and then experimented with false positive deactivation agent to assess its features and functionalities by playing around it with examples.
* Lastly, Safaa's performance was critically evaluated, and strategies for acquiring data for my Copyright script was discussed with me


## Subsequent Steps
* I was tasked to begin with the first task in the project list which is about the creation of script to get copyright data from a fossology instance.

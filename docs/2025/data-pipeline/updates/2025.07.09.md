# WEEK 5
*(July 02, 2025)*

## Attendees:
- [Kaushlendra Pratap](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)

### Engagements
* This week was about migration of all current available progress so far in the demo repository into the main Safaa repository.
It was really challenging and an eye-opener for me on working with the repository codebase. I faced challenges like incompatible code,
trying to fit in the codes i have written so far into the repository, and a lot of git conflict. 
I was able to resolve all the code conflict, pushed it to one of my repository branch, and submitted a pull request for review. 
But not much of the git conflict resolved.

## Meeting Discussion:
* In this week meeting, I had the opportunity to have [Kaushlendra Pratap](https://github.com/Kaushl2208) in the meeting. He worked me through resolving this git conflict,
explain what was the cause, gave me guide on how to resolve the problem, explained every line of commands we used and what it does, and how this can
be resolved if such issue comes up in the future.

## Subsequent Steps
* After submitting my code and opening a pull request, i got a lot of feedback on where i can improve, and make adjustment to make the code much better.
My main goal in the next week will be looking into this review, making corrections based on the feedbacks, and learning from it

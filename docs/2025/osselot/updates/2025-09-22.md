# Week 16

*(September 16, 2025 – September 22, 2025)*

## Meetings

*(September 20, 2025)*

### Attendees
* [Vaibhav Sahu](https://github.com/Vaibhavsahu2810)
* [Jan Altenberg](https://github.com/JanAltenberg)

## Discussions

* Clarified the idea regarding **SPDX configuration**:
  - We need configuration options at both **global** and **per-upload** levels.

* Proposed possible solution:
  1. **Extend the existing** `/uploads/{id}/conf` **endpoint** in `ConfController.php` to include SPDX configuration.

* No new endpoint is required.
The **existing `/uploads/{id}/conf` API** already supports configuring the **OSSelot export flag** and other SPDX settings through the `spdxSelection` field.


## Updates

* Completed detailed API analysis for SPDX configuration.
* Verified that the `/uploads/{id}/conf` endpoint already provides the required functionality.


## Plan for Next Week

1. Finalize testing for the SPDX configuration API integration.
3. Begin review and testing for the combined global + per-upload configuration logic.

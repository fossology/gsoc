# Week 8 meeting and activities

_(July 16,2024)_

## Attendees

-   [Divij Sharma](https://github.com/dvjsharma)
-   [Gaurav Mishra](https://github.com/GMishx)
-   [Valens Niyonsenga](https://github.com/valens200)

## Discussion

-   Discussed the implementation of `/jobs`, `/jobs/{id}`, `/jobs/all` endpoints.
-   Following suggestions/improvements were discussed:
    1. The `/jobs/history` endpoint can be safely deprecated in V2, since the same functionality can be achieved by using the `/jobs?upload=<id>` endpoint.
    2. The `startTime` and `endTime` fields in the `jobQueue` do not contain the timezone information. It was suggested to add the timezone information to these fields and make the format consistent with the `queueDate` field.
    3. The output should be sorted by the `queueDate` field in descending order, so that the latest jobs are displayed first.
    4. For the failing tests, it was suggested to cut out additional data from the mid-function calls and mock the object as a whole.
-   Briefly discussed and reviewed the test case development for the REST API with [Valens](https://github.com/valens200).

## Activities

-   Implemented all the suggestions and improvements discussed in the meeting.

    -   [feat(api): modify /jobs and related endpoints](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2781)

-   Worked on documenting some improvements in the REST API implementation.

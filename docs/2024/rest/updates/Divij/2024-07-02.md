## Discussion

-   Gave updates and demo on previous week's work.
-   Discussed on the endpoint requirements for the Jobs API.

## Activities

-   Modified `/jobs`, `/jobs/{id}`, `/jobs/all` endpoints considering the following points:

    1. Currently, the structure of the `jobs` object returned by these endpoints is as follows:
        ```json
        [
            {
                "id": <job id>,
                "name": <name of the job (upload name)>,
                "queueDate": <job queue date>,
                "uploadId": <upload id of the package>,
                "userId": <user id of the user>,
                "groupId": <group id of the user>,
                "eta": <time left>,
                "status": <job status (completed, killed, failed, etc.)>
            }
        ]
        ```
        This structure has the following problems, as outlined in #[1301](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/issues/1301), #[1800](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/issues/1800) and #[1972](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/issues/1972).

            - The structure is very simple, and does not provide much information about the job.
            - For example, the `agent` triggered by the job is not present in the response.
            - There is no information about child jobs being executed, and what is the status of each child job.
            - The information about `status` is redundant and returns invalid response for some testcases.
            - (After queue was added) The parent job status is determined by the success/failure of all the jobs related to that specific upload, and not the child jobs.
            - This, along with the current structure, makes it impossible to determine what exactly failed.

    2. To handle all the things mentioned in point 1, I modified the structure as:
        ```json
        [
            {
                "id": <job id>,
                "name": <name of the job (upload name)>,
                "queueDate": <job queue date>,
                "uploadId": <upload id of the package>,
                "userId": <user id of the user>,
                "groupId": <group id of the user>,
                "eta": <time left>,
                "status": <job status (completed, killed, failed, etc.)>,
                "jobQueue": [
                    {
                        "jobQueueId": <job queue id>,
                        "jobQueueType": <job queue type (generally agent name)>,
                        "startTime": <job queue start time>,
                        "endTime": <job queue end time>,
                        "status": <job queue completion statu>,
                        "itemsProcessed": <number of items processed>,
                        "log": <location of log file if exists>,
                        "dependencies": <Array: list of dependent job queue ids>,
                        "itemsPerSec": <number of items processed per second>,
                        "canDoActions": <job can accept new actions like pause and cancel>,
                        "isInProgress": <checks if the job queue is still in progress>,
                        "isReady": <is the job ready>,
                        "download": {
                            "text": <text for download link>,
                            "link": <link to download the report
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
        ```
        This structure provides a lot more information about the job, and also provides information about the child jobs being executed, and what is the status of each child job. Attaching a screenshot of the response below.

    3. The same structure is used for the `/jobs/{id}` and `/jobs/all` endpoints.

    4. The status returned by the endpoints now depend solely on the status of the child jobs, and not all the jobs related to the upload.

-   Worked on documenting some improvements in the REST API implementation.

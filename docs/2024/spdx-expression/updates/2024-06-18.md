## Discussions

### Presentation of UI Changes

- Presented the changes made in the UI.
- Received feedback: Currently, it is not possible to add more than two licenses in a group within the license expression.
- Recieved suggestion: The button for creating a license expression (if it does not exist) should be beside the user decision.
- Informed the mentors that I will start working on the report generation part of the project.

## Activities

- Created functionality to allow licenses and groups to be added anywhere and option to remove license. Now, more than two licenses can be added to a group.

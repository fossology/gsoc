## Discussions

### Presentation of Work

- Presented my work on storing and displaying expressions.
- Initially, expressions were displayed as a separate table in the UI.
- Feedback: Expressions should be displayed in the same table as licenses.
- When changing the license of a license expression, only detected licenses should be shown as options, rather than showing all licenses.
- Inquired about how to store License Text, Acknowledgement, and Comments for licenses that are part of a license expression.
- I proposed storing these in the AST as properties of the node.
- Currently, they are stored in the `clearing_event` table.
- Suggestion: Storing them in `clearing_event` is a good idea as it can serve as an audit log to track changes.
- There should be a way for users to create an expression for a particular file with no existing expression.

## Activities

- Displayed license expressions in the same table as licenses.

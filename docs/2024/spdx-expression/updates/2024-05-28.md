## Discussions

### Prototype Presentation

- Presented a prototype for scanning expressions with OJO.
- Initially, I was storing expressions directly as strings.
- Received feedback that storing expressions as strings could not allow modifications.
- Recieved suggestion to store license names as their references (licenseId) and the relationships between them (operators).

### Schema Proposal

- Was asked to propose a schema for storing license expressions.
- Inquired if using a graph database like Neo4j would be suitable.
- It was considered a good idea but mentors suggested not to use it as mixing two databases (PostgreSQL and Neo4j) would complicate things.


## Activities

- Researched various methods to store license expressions.
- Found that an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a good way to store expressions.
- Proposed two types of [schema](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xYONSMBMQsLsGG3IIHD0gwJA0OP2-xPecLIaisIvupM/edit?usp=sharing) for storing license expressions.

# Week 2 Meeting and Activities

_(June 4, 2024)_

## Attendees:

* [Abhishek Kumar](https://github.com/abhi-kumar17871)
* [Gaurav Mishra](https://github.com/GMishx)
* [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)
* [Dearsh Oberoi](https://github.com/deo002)
* [Akash Sah](https://github.com/Akashsah2003)

## Discussions

* I presented the changes after implementing the Core and Software Profiles made in the SPDX v3.0 report in JSON-ld format to the mentor.
* I discussed with the mentors about the SPDX python tool for validation of v3.0 reports as it was not optimised for v3.0 reports. So, it was decided to look for it later or will perform the validation manually.
* Next Step: Work on JSON report generation.

## Licensing profile use cases
The Licensing profile describes the aspects of licensing for the software application under three categories (sub-directories) - Licensing, SimpleLicensing, and ExpandedLicensing.

The Licensing category describes information about declared licenses and concluded (detected) licenses. The SimpleLicensing category describes information about text-formatted licenses. The ExpandedLicensing category describes information about parseable and machine-readable licenses.

* Made a [PR#2750](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2750) for Generation of SPDX v3.0 report in JSON format.

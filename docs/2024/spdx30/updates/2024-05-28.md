## Discussions

* I presented the basic SPDX v3.0 JSON-ld format report to the mentors.
* Got a feedback for the implementation of the required fields and profiles in the reports .
* Also was asked to validate the reports generated using the [SPDX python tool](https://github.com/spdx/tools-python).
* Next Step: Work on Licensing profile in JSON-ld reports.

## Core and software profile use cases

* ### Core profile
    * The Core profile describes the foundational classes and properties that are used by all profiles of the SPDX model. 

* ### Software profile
    * The Software profile contains information about files, packages, SBOMs, snippets, and artifacts of the software application.

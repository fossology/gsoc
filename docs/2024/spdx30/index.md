## Project title

Support SPDX 3.0 Reports

## What's the project about?

This project aims to support the generation, parsing, and interpreting of SPDX 3.0 reports. Currently, FOSSology uses SPDX 2.3 for report generation and ingestion, but with the introduction of SPDX 3.0, it has become the industry standard. Upgrading to SPDX 3.0 will address the limitations of the older version, such as compatibility issues and difficulties in integrating with other tools.

In this project, I will be working on the generation of SPDX 3.0 reports in multiple formats, implementing SPDX 3.0 profiles, and then the ingestion of these reports.

## What should be done?

1. Support generation of SPDX 3.0 reports in multiple formats
    - Include support for JSON-LD, plain JSON, tag:value, RDF, and CSV formats to meet diverse needs and use cases.

2. Support of SPDX 3.0 profiles
    - Begin with Core, Software, and Licensing profiles.
    - Expand to additional profiles such as Lite if possible.

3. Support ingestion of SPDX 3.0 reports
    - Ensure FOSSology can read and process SPDX 3.0 reports for seamless integration and compliance.

4. Improve compatibility and standardization
    - Ensure smoother integration and compliance with industry standards.

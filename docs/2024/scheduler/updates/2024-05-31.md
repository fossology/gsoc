### Contributor

  - [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78): Reading through the Job Scheduler [Documentation](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/wiki/Job-Scheduler) led to the frame current Scheduler.

**Current Scheduler Design**
---

The Schematic frame out of Documentation illustrates about architectural overview of Job Scheduler.

*Architectural Overview:*

It is based on Client-Server model, where: 

1. **Scheduler Port:** It serves as the communication hub for clients and the scheduler.
2. **Main Thread:** It is responsible for job queuing, job allocation, and event management.
3. **Worker Threads:** They are implemented to handle specific tasks asynchronously, increasing throughput and reducing response times.

*Key Components:*

1. **Scheduler:** Coordinates all job scheduling operations and serves as the entry point for job requests.
2. **Asynchronous Workers:** Handle tasks in parallel, significantly improving processing time.
3. **Logging and Monitoring:** Integrated logging system for real-time monitoring and troubleshooting.

## Does the Current Scheduler Design align with Job Scheduler [Documentation](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/wiki/Job-Scheduler)?

### Mentor
- [Gaurav Mishra](https://github.com/GMishx): Yes, it aligns with current architecture of job scheduler.


**New Scheduler Design**
---

The revised schematic of Job Scheduler design focuses on an efficient multithreaded approach.that illustrates architectural overview of Job Scheduler.

*Architectural Overiew:*

1. **Main Thread:** Coordinates with various components of the scheduler and ensures that tasks are handed over to the appropriate threads for execution.

2. **Worker Thread:** Handles interactions between different agents (or services) that are part of the scheduler. This thread ensures that all components are synchronized and operate without conflicts.

3. **Event Queue:** Handles all system-level events and ensures proper event handling and error logging.

*Key Components:*

1. **Scheduler:** Acts as the central command that receives tasks from the client. It uses a round-robin technique for managing tasks, ensuring a fair and efficient distribution of CPU time among tasks.

2. **Queue Storage:** This component is responsible for holding the tasks before they are processed. It operates under the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle but is managed dynamically to adapt to varying workload conditions.

**Trade-off**

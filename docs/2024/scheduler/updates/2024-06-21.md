## Discussion

 - [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78):I've conducted an in-depth analysis of a specific use case, highlighting several key features:

    1. Mutual exclusivity between dependent and independent queues.
    2. Implementation of a rate limit using a **sliding window log**.
    3. Use of semaphores for synchronization between both queues.
    4. Integration of a feedback service in the application using *[Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/)*.

  - [Kaushlendra Pratap](https://github.com/Kaushl2208): Considering the use of multiple semaphores, what strategies can be implemented to prevent deadlocks?

  - [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78): Hadn't considered it much? Could it be managed with a single semaphore?

  - [Gaurav Mishra](https://github.com/GMishx): What are your thoughts on implementing a heartbeat mechanism? I was considering that it might be feasible to implement using Grafana or a custom solution. By developing a custom heartbeat mechanism, we could establish our own rules.

  - [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78): Yes, we can do it.

  - [Katharina Ettinger](https://github.com/EttingerK): Given all the use cases, what approach should be taken based on the project size and the level of analysis an user encounters?

  - [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78): It's recognized as a limitation of the current architecture. I plan to focus on this issue and conduct more thorough research to address it.

  - [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd): Could you integrate functionality within the dependent queue to prioritize running tasks for users with smaller projects or lower analysis needs, thereby reducing their time consumption?

 - [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78): Since the dependent queue manages a list of jobs tailored to each user, leveraging multiprogramming and multiple instances, it's not feasible to derive benefits directly from this setup.

- [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78):Following the discussions and results, the architecture exhibits several limitations:
    1. Using multiple semaphores could lead to deadlocks.
    2. Employing a single semaphore under extreme conditions undermines the concept of multiprogramming.
    3. The necessity for a load balancer to prioritize users based on analysis depth or package size. 
    4. Implementation of a heartbeat mechanism to monitor system health.

 further research and development could focus on these aspects.

## Discussuion:

### Contributor:
  - [Aaditya Singh](https://github.com/Aaditya-Singh78):Could you give me more information about the ER diagram? I want to understand the parameters that need to be included in the code.

  - [Gaurav Mishra](https://github.com/GMishx): Discuss about Data in database & there are specific criteria that need to be adhered to when running the scheduler.

    1. Certain agents, such as delagent and software heritage, can only run one instance at a time. This is time-consuming for a user who needs to run other agents.

    2. Some agents utilize external APIs that have rate limits. If requests exceed these limits, the APIs might restrict access or even block the user from using and processing the agent.

    3. There is a maintenance agent designed to assist with our website by fixing dependencies and addressing other performance-related tasks.

    4. Responsiveness should be prioritized so that if a user-1 makes a request earlier, their analysis should be completed before others.

## Discussion:

### Linux License Dataset
Created a larger, more comprehensive dataset of licenses from Linux sources. This dataset includes line-level annotations to indicate which lines contain license-relevant information.

### Refined Semantic Search
Continued refining the semantic search implementation:

- Explored Alternative Models: Tested other sentence transformer models and potential alternatives, but determined that the current model (all-mpnet-base-v2) was not a bottleneck.

### Performance Metrics
Introduced two key metrics to evaluate semantic search effectiveness:

- Accuracy: Measures if at least one relevant line is found per file (binary: 0 or 100%). **The current model achieved 96% accuracy on the Linux dataset.**
- Coverage: Calculates the percentage of relevant lines found within each file. **The average coverage across files was 80%.**

## Conclusions and Next Steps
- Give semantic search one more week and focus on improving license matching accuracy.

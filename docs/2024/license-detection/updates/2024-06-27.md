# Meeting 5

*(June 27,2024)*

## Attendees:
- [Kaushlendra Pratap](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)
- [Gaurav Mishra](https://github.com/GMishx)
- [Shaheem Azmal M MD](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)
- [Ayush Bhardwaj](https://github.com/hastagAB)
- [Avinal Kumar](https://github.com/avinal)


## Discussion:

### Improved Semantic Search Performance
- Accuracy: Increased to nearly 100% (98.7% in the meeting, with slight discrepancies attributed to labeling errors).
- Coverage: Enhanced to over 93% (potentially closer to 96% when accounting for labeling issues).

### License Matching Exploration
- Hierarchical Approach: Attempted a two-step semantic search approach:
  1. Use existing code to identify top K similar lines.
  2. Perform line-by-line semantic search against all SPDX license text lines.
- Performance Issues: This approach proved computationally expensive, taking hours to process small samples.
- Fuzzy Matching (Post-Meeting): Explored the fuzzywuzzy library (based on Levenshtein distance) for the second step of license matching, yielding significantly improved results.

### License Matching Metrics
- Predicted License Accuracy: 68% (This indicates the percentage of files where at least one license was correctly matched.)
- Predicted Licenses Covered: 62.5% (This measures the percentage of all licenses within the explored files that were correctly identified and matched.)

### Key Findings
- **Performance Breakthrough with Fuzzy Matching**: Switching to fuzzy matching with fuzzywuzzy significantly enhanced license matching accuracy and coverage compared to the initial hierarchical semantic search approach.

## Conclusions and Next Steps
- Integrate Semantic Search with LLMs: Begin combining semantic search results with LLM analysis to achieve a more comprehensive and accurate license identification solution.
- Refine Fuzzy Matching: Continue exploring and refining fuzzy matching parameters to further improve license matching performance.
- Analyze Combined Performance: Establish metrics and analyze the effectiveness of the integrated semantic search and LLM approach.

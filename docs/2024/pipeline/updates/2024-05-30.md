## Discussion:
* I installed Fossology and familiarized myself with its features. Furthermore, I conducted tests with Fossology's current copyright detection agent and the experimental false positive deactivation agent to assess their effectiveness and determine areas for enhancement.
* There were discussions on strategies such as gathering unidentified copyrights or establishing a shadow model based on the current framework. Additionally, refinements in fine-tuning and training were considered to enhance decluttering and detection capabilities.
* Lastly, Safaa's performance was critically evaluated, and strategies for acquiring additional data were deliberated upon.
* I missed the general meeting due to connection issues from my side.

### Enagagements
I engaged in a call with my colleague Abdel, who had previously worked on developing Safaa, to clarify several doubts regarding the agent. During our discussion, I learned that Nirjas was already proficient in performing the task, and the agent began its operations after Nirjas had extracted copyrights.



## Subsequent Steps
* I was tasked with presenting a comprehensive overview of the project in the next meeting, outlining plans for processing new data, explaining the working of current Safaa and explaining the retrieval of gathering the new proposed data.

# WEEK 3
*(June 13, 2024)*

## Updates
* I had my semester exams running hence I could not make it to the meeting
* During the week, [Gaurav](https://github.com/GMishx) provided me with a brief overview of Fossology's database structure, explaining the layout and organization of the copyright and copyright_events tables.

## Subsequent Steps
* Post-exams, I plan to experiment with the script by connecting it to my local Fossology database to retrieve the copyright notices.
* Once the exams conclude, my focus will shift to retrieving the datasets and preparing the framework.

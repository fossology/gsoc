## Discussions

* Discussed [unified diff](https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/html_node/Example-Unified.html) format to populate the data fetched from the Github and Gitlab API's
* We also discussed after extraction of the content in unified diff format, how will we extract the line number from it.
* We discussed potential risks that we had to keep in mind before approaching this:
  * The scanner results should give required info for searching line number.
  * The scanner results should not be affected by this.


## Updates
* Came across [this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24455377/git-diff-with-line-numbers-git-log-with-line-numbers) on stackoverflow. Used this gawk command as a reference and wrote a python script to convert the api content into unified diff format.
* Create a new class `FormatResult` to handle all the formatting of the results and diff content.
* Also, created a function to extract the line number from the formatted diff content.
* Tested both the scripts extensively and all cover potential edge cases.

## Planning for next week
* Use the script on the diff content and try to find the line number for copyright and keyword scanners.
* Add relevant byte info to the JSON output of nomos scanner.
* Figure out what to do for repo scans.

# Week 4
*(June 21, 2024 - June 27, 2024)*

## Meeting 1
*(June 26, 2024)*

## Attendees
* [Rajul Jha](https://github.com/rajuljha)

* [Shaheem Azmal](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)
* [Avinal Kumar](https://github.com/avinal)
* Katharina

## Discussions

* Talked about how the differential scans need to work in detail, like:
  * Should they be triggered on `release` only? As it makes sense to scan between two different versions when a new release it being published.
  * Or should the user be able to scan between two different versions via any sort of trigger, like on `push` or `commit` as well?
* Talked about the current implementation of custom keyword functionality, and how it can be
  extrapolated similarly for different scanners also.
* We talked about fleshing out the design and implementation details first, then work on improving speed.

## Work Done

* Completed custom keyword functionality. [(#PR2769)](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2769) The details are as follows:
  * User can now setup a GH Action or Gitlab CI pipeline and pass environment variables to scan for custom keywords however they want. This gives them immense control over what they wan't to scan.
  * Added some validity checks for the `keyword.conf` file as during testing, I found out that the scanner breaks if an invalid file is passed to it.
  * Set up a test docker image [(rjknightmare/fo-ci-test:latest)](https://hub.docker.com/layers/rjknightmare/fo-ci-test/latest/images/sha256-ac72768b8c4383a4aca05a50cd53ae427db9645b42619ad82b53e38b3b876b38?context=repo) for testing.
Here are the test results for the same:
    * GH Actions:

    * Gitlab CI:

* Set up qemu emulator for the Github Actions environment to provide multiple architecture support, which also reduced the time for action execution significantly.

* Studied about how we can implement differential (between two different versions) scans and explored these use cases:
  * Use Case I: On `release`
  * Use Case II: On `push`, `commit` or any other event trigger.


## Planning for next week

* Study further on above use cases and work out a plan for the same.
* Explore the GH Actions and Gitlab API's and use the best endpoints for our use cases.
* Then start working on implementation of differential scans.

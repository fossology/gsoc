## Discussions

* Worked on adding nomos json output. But not able to access the theMatches object's licenseAndMatchPositions object. Stuck on this for nomos task. 
* Bumped up spdx_tools library to latest version. Tested with both platforms (GH Actions and Gitlab).
* Discussed an issue in the github workflow, not supporting multiple architectures.
  * The GH Actions Runner does not support multi-architecture images.
  * We discussed potential solutions for the same including trying to build the image in the GH Action itself or utilizing an emulator like qemu. 

## Work Done

* Upgraded the spdx_tools library [(#PR2762)](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2762) and did performance analysis for both versions.
    * With Version `0.0.0a2`:

    * With Version `0.8.2`:

* Worked on providing custom `keyword.conf` file during CI pipeline. It works as follows:
  * User creates a custom `keyword.conf` file following [this](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/blob/master/src/copyright/agent/keyword.conf) pattern.
  * They set an environment variable called `KEYWORD_CONF_FILE_PATH` in CI providers settings and set its value to the path of the `keyword.conf` file.
  * Then, when the pipeline is triggered, say on `push` to `main`, then the keyword scanner reads the custom file and scans for the keywords specified by the user.
  * Keep in mind that the current keyword file is overwritten by the script, as discussed with the mentors.

## Planning for next week

* Test the keyword functionality with GH Actions and Gitlab CI and send out a PR for the same.
* Work on providing multi architecture support for GH Actions.
* Study about how to implement differential scans.

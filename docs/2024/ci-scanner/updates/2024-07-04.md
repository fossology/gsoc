## Discussions
* I showed my progress regarding differential scans and `allowlist` functionality. 
* Discussed doubts regarding the nomos scanner `-J` flag. We'll tackle this later for now.
* Mentors mentioned that we should now work towards providing a `fossology action` which will
  provide smooth integration into Github Actions.
* Created a new repository in fossology, called `fossology-action` for now.

## Work Done
* Researched and tested the relevant API endpoints from the Github and Gitab API's:
  * Github API: `https://api.github.com/repos/:owner/:repo/compare/{:tag1}...{:tag2}`

* Implement differential scans and tested on Github and Gitlab and sent out a [PR(#2775)](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2775) for the same.
* Solved some bugs found in the previous [PR(#2574)](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2754#issuecomment-2196527812).
* Resolved and corrected some issues in [PR(#2754)](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2754) and [PR(#2769)](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2769) respectively.
* Started implementing the functionality that allows passing `allowlist.conf` file from a custom location
  by the user.


## Planning for next week
* Complete the `allowlist.conf` part and send a PR for the same.
* Next, start researching and testing which type of Github Action we should create. Currently, there are three choices:
  * **JavaScript Action**
  * **Docker Action**
  * **Composite Action**
* **Docker Action** and **Composite Action** are most *relevant* to our use case. Need to test and find out which is a better fit for us.
* Start working on providing and then releasing the action to the marketplace.
* PS: Also need to think about a cool name for the action :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

# Week 2
*(June 6, 2024 - June 13, 2024)*

## Meeting 1
*(June 12, 2024)*

## Attendees
* [Rajul Jha](https://github.com/rajuljha)
* [Gaurav](https://github.com/GMishx)
* [Kaushlendra](https://github.com/Kaushl2208)
* [Shaheem Azmal](https://github.com/shaheemazmalmmd)

## Discussions

* Mentors reviewed my PR's and gave me feedback like changes regarding squashing commits into one.
* There was a discussion regarding the copyright and keyword scanners breaking because of new formatting since they are regex based. I tested the code and it was working without any descrepencies.
* Mentors gave me pointers for adding byte info to nomos, which I was unable to figure out before.
* I also found a bug in `SpdxReport` where it breaks when an unknown license reference is found by the scanner. I had a discussion with the mentors regarding solving it.

## Updates
* Completed the Format Results functionality for the copyright and keyword scanners. :grin:
  * Add the line numbers to the STDOUT, text_report and bom report function.
  * Sent out a [PR(#2754)](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2754) with the given changes.
* Add the line numbers for repo scans also in a seperate [PR(#2756)](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/pull/2756)

## Planning for next week
* Add line numbers for the remaining nomos and ojo scanners which requires:
  * Adding relevant byte info to the JSON output of nomos scanner.
* Solve the bug found in `SpdxReport`.
* Upgrade the spdx_tools library to latest version.
* Try to figure out a method of providing custom keyword scanning by providing a path to a custom `keyword.conf` file by the user.

## Activities

- Created FOSSOlogy maintenance page.
- Created Duplicate BucketPool Page.
- Created the pull request for FOSSology maintenance page.
- Started to implement the APIs for FOSSology maintenance.
- Decided to quit the development of Duplicate BucketPool page for now
  since it's not urgent yet. 


## Explanation

The FOSSOlogy maintenance and the Duplicate BucketPool page from the Admin section
were not available. In this week i managed to add these new pages as a part of the UI
project.

## What's the project about?

Organisations are finding it more challenging to keep track of the numerous licences
and conditions under which they are permitted to utilise open-source components
as a result of the rising popularity of open-source software. Open-source licences
can be challenging to comprehend in terms of how they relate to a particular piece
of software or work with other licences. Organisations like FOSSology and SW360
can utilise it for a variety of things, like licence identification, filtering,
and management.

## What should be done?

There are two parts of the project:

- First part is the creating a database service
  - Adding the data components related to licenses.
  - Database will help us to fetch the desired data using the API.

- Second part is API Designing:
  - Adding endpoints related to the license database.
  - Adding various query parameters as a filter.
  - To add fuzzy search for the license text.
  - Adding the endpoints related to authentication of the API.

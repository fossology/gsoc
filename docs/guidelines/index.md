# Attention all students! 👨‍💻

Are you ready to take on the challenge of Google Summer of Code with FOSSology?

- Start by immersing yourself in the [Google Summer of Code Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/), and keep the timeline handy as a daily reminder of your goals.

- Get some valuable tips and tricks by reading the [Advice for Students](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2011/03/dos-and-donts-of-google-summer-of-code.html).
- Take a few minutes to watch the [GSoC video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6IP_6HG2QE) for students, and get a feel for the program.
- Watch [FOSSology Using: End-to-end workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZqU5ZALI7U).
- Browse the [FOSSology GSoC 2023 project ideas](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/discussions/2371) and find something that ignites your passion.
- If you don't see a project that speaks to you, don't be shy! Reach out to the FOSSology community in the slack channel and propose a new idea.
- Keep in mind that the Ideas list is updated by GSoC admins, so if you don't see any recent updates, don't hesitate to ping a mentor for more information. Let's make this a summer to remember!

## Begin communication in [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/fossology/shared_invite/enQtNzI0OTEzMTk0MjYzLTYyZWQxNDc0N2JiZGU2YmI3YmI1NjE4NDVjOGYxMTVjNGY3Y2MzZmM1OGZmMWI5NTRjMzJlNjExZGU2N2I5NGY)

To get started, join our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/fossology/shared_invite/enQtNzI0OTEzMTk0MjYzLTYyZWQxNDc0N2JiZGU2YmI3YmI1NjE4NDVjOGYxMTVjNGY3Y2MzZmM1OGZmMWI5NTRjMzJlNjExZGU2N2I5NGY) and introduce yourself.

In the first communication, we would be interested to see the following information:

- A short self-introduction: your area of study, interests, background
- Why are you interested in the FOSSology project? Which projects ideas do you want to work on?
- If you participated in open-source projects, please reference them
- If you have a GitHub, Twitter account, blog, or any technical/scientific publications, don't hesitate to share those as well..

As you dive into the codebase, use the Slack channel to ask for feedback on your project ideas and for help as you navigate the code. 

Remember, the more specific and clear your questions are, the more likely you are to get a helpful response. So don't be afraid to get specific, like: ``I'm interested in Project X, and I've noticed issues Y and Z. It looks like a, b, and c are already implemented. Can I pitch a project that would complete d, e, and f?"
We're here to help you make the most of your time with us, so don't hesitate to reach out!``

## First contribution

Looking to make your mark in the world of open-source and increase your chances of being selected for Google Summer of Code? The key is to dive in and get your hands dirty with the software.

What better way to learn about a tool than by contributing to its development? Whether fixing bugs or adding new features, your contributions can make a real difference.

Here's a general roadmap to follow:

- Find an issue, bug, or proposed feature that catches your interest. Also you can have look at [good first issues](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/contribute).
- Make a copy of the repository (known as "forking").
- Roll up your sleeves and make your improvements.
- Submit a well-documented pull request, including all the relevant details about your changes. Also, be sure to follow the [Git commit conventios](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/blob/17bca5f198bfa9c6529984ed9bde56772964ffd7/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-conventions).
- Be patient and wait for feedback and discussion on Github (reviews can take some time).

We can't stress enough the importance of making some contributions to the project before you submit your GSoC application. Not only will it help you fine-tune your proposal, but it will also show the mentors that you're invested in the community and are dedicated to making a difference.

## GSoC Contributor Proposals
As a GSoC contributor, your proposal is the key to unlocking the doors of opportunity. 

We expect your proposal to be a shining example of all the elements discussed in the [Google Summer of Code Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/), particularly the "[Elements of a Quality Proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal#elements-of-a-quality-proposal)."

Don't wait until the last minute to submit your proposal. Connect with the mentors as early as possible. The earlier you start, the more time you'll have to fine-tune your proposal and receive valuable feedback. If you wait until the last few days, there may not be enough time for mentors to give your proposal the attention it deserves.

In your proposal, be sure to disclose all known commitments that may overlap with any of the program phases(community bonding, coding periods, evaluation periods, etc.):

- Disclose your vacations periods, part-time or full-time job, school, classes, tests, exams, periods of non-availability, etc.
- Unexpected events: we understand there can be unexpected events in life, and those cannot be planned. Please inform us as soon as possible if you need time away from the program. You can use private messaging for sensitive information.

## GSoC Contributor Selection Process

Once the application period is over, administrators and mentors make a decision on which proposal to accept based on the proposal submitted to the Google Summer of Code website.

## Congratulations, you have been selected…​ or not.

We thank all GSoC contributors who reach out to us during the application period. If you have not been selected, [read this](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/being-turned-down), there could be many reasons, and some are even outside of our control. Do not feel bad, we encourage you to stay with the community and apply again next year.

If you have been selected, we extend our warmest congratulations! The community bonding period starts within two days after the official announcement, so get ready to dive into the exciting world of open-source development with FOSSology.

## Community Bonding

As soon as the GSoC contributors are accepted, the community bonding period starts. During this period, contributors are not expected to be coding immediately. Instead, they are expected to prepare to code.
A thriving community bonding period leads to successful coding, so make the most of it!

Use the community bonding to:

- Define the communication channels with your mentors.
- Schedule weekly meetings with your mentors.
- Continue to discuss and plan the project with the community and the mentors.
- Set up your computer and development environment to work on the project (see [Useful links](#useful-links)).

## Coding Periods

During the coding periods, GSoC contributors are expected to:

- Work on the GSoC project.
- Follow the [Code Style Best Practices](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/wiki/Coding-Style).
- Write a short summary of the work done each week, published to FOSSolgy GSoC tracker. It is also advisable to publish in a personal blog as well. As an example, you can check out the [weekly progress updates](https://fossology.github.io/gsoc/docs/2022/reuse/updates/2022-06-13) for the Adopting REUSE standards in FOSSology project during GSoC 2022.
    - ``It’s okay to say things like <this> and <that> were challenging because of <reason>.``
- Say something when you are stuck, lost in the code, confused about the objectives, etc.
- Notify in advance when taking time off and make use of weekends to rest and avoid burnout.
- Be present online and proactively reach out to the community if required.

## Evaluations

At the end of each coding period, GSoC contributors are expected to:

- Publish a blog post summarizing your status on your blog or on Medium.
- Announce the blog post on the [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/fossology/shared_invite/enQtNzI0OTEzMTk0MjYzLTYyZWQxNDc0N2JiZGU2YmI3YmI1NjE4NDVjOGYxMTVjNGY3Y2MzZmM1OGZmMWI5NTRjMzJlNjExZGU2N2I5NGY).

## Post-GSoC

Congratulations on reaching the end of GSoC! You've accomplished so much, and the journey has only just begun. Once the final results are announced by Google, it's not the end of the road for you. Here are a few options for you to consider:

- Keep the momentum going and continue to develop your project within the FOSSology community.
- Help us in keeping the documentations updated.
- Give presentations/talks about your work during GSoC.
- Apply again next year and take on another exciting challenge.
- Share your knowledge and experience by becoming a mentor in Google Summer of Code for the next year.

So, don't put away your development tools just yet, and keep in touch with the community; there are more opportunities waiting for you.

## FAQs
**Q. How can I improve my chances of getting selected for GSoC?**

A: There are a few key things you can do to increase your chances of getting selected. These include writing a compelling project proposal, engaging with the community, successfully contributing to the project, and demonstrating that you can work independently.

**Q. How early should I start working on my proposal?**

A: The earlier, the better! Make sure to get feedback from mentors before submitting your proposal. This will help you to refine the details and make it as strong as possible. Keep in mind that mentors will need some time to review your proposal, so starting early will give you the best chance of success.

**Q. I don't have any experience in the skill XYZ. What should I do?**

A: Not necessarily. One way to gain experience is by working on good first issues. In software development, it's common to develop experience and expertise as you take on and complete projects successfully.
